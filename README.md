# Homework

This repository contains solutions to my university homework, including exercises and final projects. Problem texts are also included, and wherever appropriate, instructions on building and running software programs are provided as well.

## Disclaimer

The solutions provided here are NOT guaranteed to be correct, or complete. Some solutions may be missing. Software projects in this repo are mostly unmaintained and their source code is from months or years ago; so they might not build or run properly at the time.
