# Exercises

Exercises were done individually. LaTeX source files are also included.

## Compiling
`xelatex` was used to compile source files. Several LaTeX packages, most notably `xepersian` were also used and need to be installed before compiling.

After installing `xelatex` and required packages, compile `.tex` files:

```bash
cd "OS/Exercises/MySolutions/LaTeX Source Files"
xelatex ./HW05.tex
```

The resuling PDF file will be available with the same name as the `.tex` file (eg. `HW05.pdf`).

Note that for some of the files, you may need to compile several times to get the proper output in the final PDF file.
